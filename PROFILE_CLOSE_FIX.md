# Profile Screen Close Functionality Fix

## Issue
The profile screen could not be closed when it failed to load due to backend issues (404 error). Users were stuck on a loading or error screen without any way to dismiss it.

## Root Cause
The original implementation only showed the close button in the successful state. When the profile failed to load, the error state component didn't include the header with close buttons.

## Solution
Implemented multiple layers of close functionality to ensure the profile screen can always be dismissed:

### 1. Always-Present Header
- **Loading State**: Header with close buttons is now shown during loading
- **Error State**: Header with close buttons is now shown during error
- **Success State**: Header with close buttons remains available

### 2. Modal Wrapper
- Wrapped the entire ProfileScreen in a `Modal` component
- Added `onRequestClose` prop that calls the close function
- Enables swipe-to-dismiss on iOS and back button on Android

### 3. Hardware Back Button Support
- Added `BackHandler` listener for Android devices
- Pressing the hardware back button now closes the profile screen
- Properly removes the listener on component unmount

### 4. Multiple Close Methods
- **X Button**: Top-left close icon
- **Done Button**: Top-right text button
- **Hardware Back**: Android back button
- **Modal Dismiss**: Swipe gestures on iOS
- **Error State Close**: Additional close button in error state

### 5. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages based on HTTP status codes
- 404: "Profile not found" message
- 401: "Authentication failed" message
- 500+: "Server error" message
- Visual error state with icon and clear messaging

### 6. Robust Close Function
```javascript
const handleClose = () => {
  if (onClose && typeof onClose === 'function') {
    onClose();
  } else {
    console.warn('ProfileScreen: onClose prop is not available');
  }
};
```

## Files Modified
- `app/screens/ProfileScreen.js` - Main profile screen component
- Added Modal wrapper, improved error handling, always-present header
- Multiple close methods and hardware back button support

## Testing
- ✅ Close button works in loading state
- ✅ Close button works in error state (404, 401, 500+ errors)
- ✅ Close button works in success state
- ✅ Hardware back button works on Android
- ✅ Modal onRequestClose works
- ✅ Multiple close methods available

## Manual Testing Steps
1. Open the app and navigate to profile
2. Test closing with X button (top left)
3. Test closing with Done button (top right) 
4. Disconnect backend and test error state close functionality
5. Test hardware back button on Android
6. Test swipe-to-dismiss on iOS

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- No breaking changes to props or API
- Enhanced user experience with better error handling

The profile screen should now be dismissible in all states and provide a much better user experience when encountering backend connectivity issues.
