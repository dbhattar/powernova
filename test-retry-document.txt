This is a test document to verify the retry mechanism works properly for Pinecone timeouts.
The document contains multiple sentences to create several chunks.
This will test the exponential backoff retry strategy.
We want to ensure that temporary network issues or gateway timeouts don't cause document processing to fail.
The retry mechanism should handle 504 Gateway Timeout errors gracefully.
Each retry attempt should wait progressively longer before trying again.
This helps reduce load on the Pinecone servers during high traffic periods.
The system should be resilient to temporary failures while still reporting persistent errors.
After successful retries, document processing should continue normally.
This test document will help verify that the improvements are working correctly.
