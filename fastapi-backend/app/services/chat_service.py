Key components of LMP:
1. **Energy Component**: Base cost of generation
2. **Congestion Component**: Additional cost due to transmission constraints
3. **Loss Component**: Cost of electrical losses in transmission

LMP varies by location and time due to:
- Transmission congestion
- Generation costs
- Electrical losses
- Demand patterns
