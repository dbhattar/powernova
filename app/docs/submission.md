# Submitting Your Expo React Native App to App Stores

## 1. Prepare Your App
- Update your appâ€™s metadata in `app.json` (name, slug, version, icon, etc.).
- Test your app thoroughly on both platforms (Android and iOS).

## 2. Build Standalone App Binaries
Expo makes this easy with EAS (Expo Application Services):

1. **Install EAS CLI** (if not already):
   ```
npm install -g eas-cli
   ```
2. **Log in to Expo:**
   ```
eas login
   ```
3. **Configure EAS:**
   ```
eas build:configure
   ```
4. **Build for Android:**
   ```
eas build -p android --profile production
   ```
   This will generate an `.aab` file for Google Play.
5. **Build for iOS:**
   ```
eas build -p ios --profile production
   ```
   This will generate an `.ipa` file for the App Store.

## 3. Submit to App Stores

### Android (Google Play)
- Go to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console).
